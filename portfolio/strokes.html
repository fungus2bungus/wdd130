                <h1>Stroke - Freestyle</h1>
                <p>This should already be familiar to you, pretty much the easiest stroke of the bunch. The basics here are you pull with one arm at a time in rotation while you kick up and down with each leg independently or flutter kick</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strokes are done by pulling with one arm at a time
                    </li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>

            <section class="stroke2">
                <h1>Stoke - Backstroke</h1>
                <p>This is also a pretty common stroke, very similar to free except you're on your back. The general idea is similar to free, except you want to feel a lot more power in your pull as you'll end up pushing the water behind you. Make sure you keep your neck and head flat, you'll slow down a lot if you try to lift them up.</p>

            <section class="stroke3">
                <h1>Stroke - Breastroke</h1>
                <p>Now this is the first tricky one we get to, the best way I can describe it is that it looks like frog in the water. You're going to pull with both arms apart starting from the center while moving your elbows back and then shooting your arms forward. While doing this, you're going to kick by bringing both your legs forward by bending the knees so their most forward, then you're going to bring both legs back together right before you shoot your arms forward </p>

            <section class="stroke4">
                <h1>Stroke - Butterfly</h1>
                <p>This is another tricky one, the two most important things here like breastroke are 1. rythmn and 2. endurance/power. You're going to be pulling with both arms at the same time, with your hands entering in the water thumbs first with the back of your hands facing forward(or towards the wall your swimming towards), then as you pull you're goin to lift your chest a little bit, then kick down with both legs. Rinse, Repeat; keep the rythmn up</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>50 yards/meters - All out sprint. Go as fast as you can and try to breathe as little as possible.</li>
                    <li>100 - Very fast. While twice as long as a 50, if experienced enough at this point, you should be going only slightly slower. Again, try not to breath a ton as it will slow you down. Make sure to really nail your turns.</li>
                    <li>200 - Fast/Smooth. This is a tricky one. Go fast but not too fast. This is going to be the one where you have to pace yourself correctly or basically just get a bit faster over time. This way you don't wear yourself out and end up going as fast as you can at the end.</li>
                    <li>500 - Alright so those who've done high school swim will know this one. It's hard without a game plan. Luckily, ain't to complex: get faster over time. Start out around 70ish percent of your total speed and slowly get faster each 50 or 100(depends on your endurance). Also, don't let the fatigue get to your head. From personal experience you can use your opponents as a bit of a judge on whether or not you're going too slow or fast, ie: you're way ahead too early or way behind</li>
                </ul>
