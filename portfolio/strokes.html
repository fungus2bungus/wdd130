                <h1>Stroke - Freestyle</h1>
                <p>This should already be familiar to you, pretty much the easiest stroke of the bunch. The basics here are you pull with one arm at a time in rotation while you kick up and down with each leg independently or flutter kick</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strokes are done by pulling with one arm at a time
                    </li>

            <section class="stroke2">
                <h1>Stoke - Backstroke</h1>
                <p>This is also a pretty common stroke, very similar to free except you're on your back. The general idea is similar to free, except you want to feel a lot more power in your pull as you'll end up pushing the water behind you. Make sure you keep your neck and head flat, you'll slow down a lot if you try to lift them up.</p>

                <h1>Stroke - Breastroke</h1>
                <p>Now this is the first tricky one we get to, the best way I can describe it is that it looks like frog in the water. You're going to pull with both arms apart </p>
