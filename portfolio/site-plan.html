      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This site is for people who want to know the basics of competitive swimming who have little to no prior background knowledge, so ranging from people who are just curious to those looking to start competitive swimming but don’t have a source in guiding them. This site will function as a brief introduction to each of the strokes, events, techniques, best practices, drills and other ways to improve through one’s journey in competitive swimming. This will all be covered in a manner that requires less vocabulary understanding from those experienced in the sport, in other words: this will be a guide for beginners in a digestible format.</p>

      <p>People viewing this site can expect to learn what the basic strokes in competitive swimming are, their associated events along with good technique, form and strategies for each stroke and event. This will be explained in simple language along with the methods to learn and practice these strokes in an effective manner. They will also learn how to approach each event as despite their being only four strokes, each event has a completely different game plan to it.</p>

      <p>Visitors will interact with the site by reading the information about competitive swimming. It will consist of explanations of each stroke along  side each corresponding event with additional information on swimming basics and swimming technique.</p>
        
      <p>People will visit my site over others because it will be the most approachable and clean site covering this topic as most sources for this information are for already invested and seasoned swimmers and coaches. Additionally, most sites that do have similar information are generally sports publications with news being their primary focus and the general information of how the sports work is significantly more difficult to encounter. On top of that, sources that are educational are either only the form of physical media which comes with another issue that they’re not free which can be a major turn off for most interested in trying the sport out.</p>
